I'm an undergraduate now in my final year in Chongqing University, majoring in Electronic Information Engineering. For my research Interest, I decide to focus on Deep learning and Machine learning. And I plan to get my master degree in HongKong or Singapore.

For my undergratuate career, my average grades is good but not excellent. I was awarded for Comprehensive Scholarship of Chongqing University for 5 times(1 for first prize, 3 for second and 1 for third), and I was also awarded for Changjiang Electronic Power Scholarship. Besides, I won the Third prize of National College Mathematics Competition. Apart from my study, I joined the choir of my university when I entered the college, and won the second prize of The third Chongqing Vocal Music Competition in 2018, the first prize of the Sixth National College Students Art Exhibition.
